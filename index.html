                    <p> I strongly believe that engineering can't be divided into different disciplines. Every type is closely related to the rest, so an engineer has to at least understand the basics of each one of them in order to be complete. That is my goal here at UCLA, build a strong basis through Mechanical Engineering and dive into as many different engineering topics as possible, ranging from CAD, to circuits and coding, in order to aquire a solid understanding of how everything collaborates to produce a final product.

                    <p>I am an enthusiastic, self-driven individual, who strives in fast paced work environments that require team collaboration and organizational skills. As a wildlife and nature admirer, i spent a lot of my free time surfing, spearfishing, scuba diving and more. College life, so far away from home (Greece) has forced me to take on cooking -- getting there. Please click on the images above for a detailed presentation of my projects.

                            <p>
                                During the seven weeks that I interned at Teradek LLC, I worked both in the production line and the engineering department in order to get a better picture of how the company is structured and what needs to be done for a product to become available to the public. 


                                <h4> Production Line </h4>

                                <img src="/Users/christosvoutsaras/Desktop/startbootstrap-freelancer-1.0.3 2/img/portfolio/Assembly Parts.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">

                                Different components needed to be soldered on the PCB board. Having no previous soldering experience this task was challenging at the beginning since I did not have the option of doing mistakes.


                                <img src="/Users/christosvoutsaras/Desktop/startbootstrap-freelancer-1.0.3 2/img/portfolio/False LCD.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                                Part of my responsibilities was to troubleshoot malfunctioning LCD screens (like the one shown in the image above). The solution most of the time came by resoldering the pins in the back of the LCD. 


                                <h4> Engineering Department</h4>

                                <img src="/Users/christosvoutsaras/Desktop/startbootstrap-freelancer-1.0.3 2/img/portfolio/Vibration Test.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                                While working in the engineering department of the company, I performed various mechanical tests on the devices. These tests included heat tests, vibration tests, drop tests and wifi range tests. The image above, shows a custom made machince that can vibrate on different speeds and a teradek device attached to it. The test included vibrating the device for thrity minutes on each of its sides and then make sure that it is still fully functional. The idea was that these vibrations would mimic the conditions under which the devices will face while being shipped using airplanes. 



                                <img src="/Users/christosvoutsaras/Desktop/startbootstrap-freelancer-1.0.3 2/img/portfolio/Spectrum Analyzer.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                                Another important aspect of my internship at Teradek was troubleshooting a new wi-fi module that performed considerably worse than the old one when transmitting at 2.4 GHz. To achieve that, we used a wifi spectrum analyzer to track the quality of the signal that the MIMO antennas transmitted. This required learning more about RF development.

                            <p>I have been working in the Energy Inovation Laboratory since my freshman year here at UCLA. During the first year I was responsible for creating CAD models, in Solidworks, of the four different wind turbine structures that we were working on. At that point I had no prior experience using Solidworks, so the task was challenging and I had to learn how to CAD online. Since the beginning of my second year, I have been working on a Python script that will be used to calculate the second moment of area of a spar of specified thickness in each airfoil profile. This will be valuable information regarding the mass properties of the turbine blades.     
                            </p>

                            <h4> CAD Models of Wind Turbine Blades  </h4>

                            Solidworks CAD model of one of the four types of blades that we worked on. To create this model, I imported the coordinates of each airfoil profile in different planes with specified distance between them and then created a loft surface to connect all the profiles together and complete the 3D model.

                            <h4>Python Script</h4>

                            <p>The best way to compute the moment of inertia of such shapes is to create a mesh that covers the shape of interest, and calculate the moment of inertia for each one of the triangles that make up the mesh. The sum of all these individual moments will then give us the total value of the moment of inertia of the given shape. Two-dimensional meshes may be made up of squares or triangles, but I chose to use the triangular mesh since it is easier to generate for arbitrary geometries using third party mesh-generation tools.</p> 

                            <img src="/Users/christosvoutsaras/Desktop/startbootstrap-freelancer-1.0.3 2/img/portfolio/Spar.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">                           

                            <p>
                            The coding language that I used to achieve that is Python, for which a number of useful modules have been written. The most important modules I used are: meshpy and shapely. Meshpy is a Python wrapper for the two dimensional Delaunay grid generation Triangle. Shapely is a Python package that can be used for manipulation and analysis of planar geometric objects. The formulas that I applied to calculate the moments of inertia for each individual triangle were:

                            <img src="/Users/christosvoutsaras/Desktop/startbootstrap-freelancer-1.0.3 2/img/portfolio/Formula 2.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">

                            where: xi  and yi are the coordinates of any polygon vertex. </p>

                            <p>
                            This script has proven to be challenging enough for me to spend a lot of time practicing my python skills, and gaining more experience debugging my code. I learned how to use the available resources to narrow down the problems that my code had and improve it.</p>

                            <img src="/Users/christosvoutsaras/Desktop/startbootstrap-freelancer-1.0.3 2/img/portfolio/Mesh 4.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <p>
                                First I tried to create meshes of random given shapes. The idea is that once this was working, it would be easier for me to import the coordinates of the spar of the airfoil profile with the specified thickness and then create that mesh. 
                            </p>

                            <img src="/Users/christosvoutsaras/Desktop/startbootstrap-freelancer-1.0.3 2/img/portfolio/Mesh 1.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <p>
                                I also played around with the grid resolution of the mesh to see how it would affect the accuracy of the computations and the run time of the script. This image shows an increased grid resolution for the mesh compared to the previous image.  
                            </p>

                            <p> Currently working on:
                                 ~ Specifying the coordinates of the spar.
                                 ~ Using the parallel axis theorem to calculate the moment of inertia of shapes that are not centered at the origin. 
                                 ~ Creating a plot that will show how the error of the computation is affected by the mesh grid resolution.
                            </p>

                            <p>This project was part of the MAE 94 - Computed Aided Design and Drafting class here at UCLA, a class devoted to teaching students how to CAD using SolidWorks. For this project, we had to form teams of three students, and each team had to design and 3D print a vehicle that can move using only three rubber bands. The image above shows the design that my team came up with. The third rubber band was cut in half and used around the wheels to increase friction with the floor.</p>

                            <img src="/Users/christosvoutsaras/Desktop/startbootstrap-freelancer-1.0.3 2/img/portfolio/Engineering drawing of the car.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">

                            <p> This image shows the engineering drawing of the main body of our vehicle. We had to create such drawings for all the parts of the car.</p>

                            <p> This image shows an exploded view of the assembly of the car, used to demonstrate the different parts of the vehicle.</p>

                            <p> An important part of this project was making sure that our vehicle could withstand the forces applied to it through the rubber bands. In order to do that we performed an FEA analysis using Solidworks to see which parts would be under the most stress and what displacement would that stress cause. To quantify the force exerted by the rubber band, we first computed the elastic constant k of the rubber bands and then calculated the maximum force it could apply based on how far we could displace it from its equilibrium position without breaking it. </p>

                            <p> This project was undoubtedly my favorite so far, because of the detailed documentation, the different skills it helped me develop, and the amount of collaboration and team communcation it required. </p>

                            <p>This project was part of an arduino competition hosted by Thales at UCLA. Each team of three of four people, had to use an arudino microcontroller and build something related to the company in two weeks.My team decided to build an automated ticket printing machine that will extend towards the driver's window to dispense the ticket, once the car is in close distance. </p>

                            <p>During the summer of 2014 I worked for Motor Oil Hellas, a leading oil company focusing on oil refining and trading. My main responsibility was to analyze petrochemical and automotive industry reports, for energy trends and technological innovations in the mobility sector until 2050. Later on the findings of my research were included in a presentation made to the president of the company.</p>

                            <p>The analysis focuses on how the technological innovations in the automotive industry will affect the energy demand around the world. A very interesting observation that I made was that each company's projections where undeniably in favor of their industry. More specifically, petroleum companies' future projections show that at least 90% of the worlds' cars will run on gas until 2050, whereas electric vehicle companies suggest that electric cars will account for the biggest part of the global car market.</p>

                                The conclusions of my analysis were the following:
                                <ol> 
                                    <li> Energy:
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Population increase leads to an increase in energy demand, as well as an overpopulation of the big cities, having implications on community patterns and energy consumption.</li>
                                            <li>Energy growth is mainly focused to non OECD countries.</li>
                                            <li>Most energy is consumed by the industry sector while the transport sector maintains a relatively low percentage.</li>
                                            <li>Oil still seems to dominate the fuel market (especially in the transport sector), even though renewable forms of energy make a fair penetration into the market.</li>
                                            <li> Coal and gas show an increase in demand mainly for industrial use</li>
